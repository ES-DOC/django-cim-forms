ESDOC-Questionnaire
===================

.. warning:: The software is currently in alpha development stage and will change rapidly.

ESDOC-Questionnaire is a Django Application that generates webforms based on CIM-compatible metadata models and Controlled Vocabularies.  It can publish the CIM documents created using those forms in an ATOM feed available to external consumers. The questionnaire is part of the ES-DOC suite of CIM-related tools.
