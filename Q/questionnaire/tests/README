Many of the tests work off of a test fixture, "q_testdata.json".

The test fixture has the following content:
* 2 registered ontologies (w/ 2 associated categorizations): cim2 & test_ontology
* 1 (non-super) user: allynt
* 3 projects: test_project, esps (legacy), & cmip6
* the standard set of institutes, sites, & synchronizations (from fixtures)
* no customizations, realizations, or publications

Many tests, however, them create their own objects on-the-fly.
