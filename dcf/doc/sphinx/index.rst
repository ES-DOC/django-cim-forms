Django-CIM-Forms (DCF) is a Django Application that generates webforms based on CIM-compatible metadata models and controlled vocabularies.  It can publish the CIM documents created using those forms in an ATOM feed available to external users.

In order to use the DCF forms, a MetadataProject and at least one MetadataVersion must be registered.  It is then possible to customize individual forms to suit a project's needs.

DCF is part of the ES-DOC suite of CIM-related tools.
