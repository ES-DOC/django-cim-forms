CIM QUESTIONNAIRE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The following instructions describe how to install the CIM Questionnaire on a Unix-type server (Cent-OS, Linux, Mac-OSX) for the purpose of starting to use and test the web application. In a production environment, the CoG should really be front-ended by a separately installed Apache httpd server (not covered here).

PRE-REQUISITES

The system must have the following Python packages installed:

o Python 2.7.2+

o Django 1.5.2+
  easy_install --upgrade django

o South
  easy_install --upgrade south

o libXML
  pip install lxml
  
a POSTGreSQL database is recommended.  However, Django also supports MySQL and SQLite3.

pip install psycopg2  (may require sudo get-apt install libpq-dev)

sometimes postgres complains about "value too long for type character varying"; that is likely a problem with Django's built-in table "auth_permission" and the field "name".that needs to change from length 50 to length 100; the SQL is:

ALTER TABLE auth_permission DROP COLUMN name;
ALTER TABLE auth_permission ADD COLUMN name character varying(100);
ALTER TABLE auth_permission ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;


 
DOWNLOAD

Download the software from the github repository:

cd <install directory>

CONFIGURATION

o review settings.py

INITIALIZATION

o python manage.py syncdb 

o python manage.py migrate cog 

o gather the static media files from the different applications into a single directory

mkdir static
python manage.py collectstatic


STARTUP

o Start the CIM Questionnaire within the embedded Django development server:
python manage.py runserver

By default, the Django server is available on port 8000
