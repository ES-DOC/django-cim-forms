Fixtures used for testing go here.

When creating fixtures use the following command:
`manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 questionnaire > <fixture file>.json`

The resultant file will contain models in a random order [see https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6726];
You may have to re-order models for tests to work:
versions, categorizations, vocabularies, projects, & projectvocabularies must come 1st;


When updating fixtures you may need to:
1) run `manage.py flush` then `manage.py syncdb`
2) migrate to the last-used fixture version, then loaddata from the last-used fixture
3) then migrate to the most-recent version, then (add/change/delete data and then) dumpdata as above
