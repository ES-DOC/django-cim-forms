    <strong>What is the CIM?</strong>
    <p>
        The Common Information Model (CIM) is a formal metadata standard used to describe processes and artifacts relevant to the Earth System modeling community.
        This includes model components, experiments, geographic grids, data files, experimental requirements, and so on.
    </p>
    <strong>What is the CIM Questionnaire?</strong>
    <p>
        The CIM Questionnaire is part of a suite of tools built around the CIM provided by the ES-DOC project.
        It allows users to create complex CIM Documents.  Those documents can then be viewed and manipulated in other tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        An interested project can register themselves with the CIM Questionnaire.
        Project administrators are able to define a subset of the CIM metadata structure which they are interested in capturing in CIM Documents.
        Project members can than use the CIM Questionnaire Editing Forms to create those documents.

{#                    The CIM is defined as a large UML Model (the conceptual "ConCIM") which gets translated into a set of XML Schemas (the application-specific "AppCIM").#}
{#                    These schemas define the structure of a CIM Instance.#}
{#                    Each CIM Instance can also be associated with a number of additional CIM Controlled Vocabularies (CVs).#}

{#                <p>#}
{#                    For example, the CIM Schema dictates that a component model can have a set of scientific properties; The CIM CV for CMIP5 atmospheric models dictates that the <i>atmospheric dynamical core</i> component can have a scientific property listing <i>prognostic variables</i> which can contain terms such as <i>surface pressure</i>, <i>wind components</i>, and so on.#}

{#                    This includes specifying the subset of the CIM Schema and Controlled Vocabularies to display and, for each property, how to render that property.#}
{#                    Properties can be rendered as required or optional, with a specific ordering, with predetermined default content or suggestions, within different categories, and so on.#}
{#                    This customization step is cruicial; It hides the full complexity of the CIM and makes the act of creating CIM Instances much more manageable.#}
