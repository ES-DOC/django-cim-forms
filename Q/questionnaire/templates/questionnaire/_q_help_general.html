            The Common Information Model (CIM) is a formal metadata standard used to describe processes and artifacts relevant to the Earth System modeling community.
            This includes model components, experiments, geographic grids, data files, experimental requirements, and so on.

    <div class="panel-heading"> What is the CIM Questionnaire?</div>
    <div class="panel-body">
         <p>
             The CIM Questionnaire is part of a suite of tools built around the CIM provided by the ES-DOC project.
             It allows users to create complex CIM Documents. Those documents can then be viewed and manipulated by other tools.
         </p>
         <p>
             An interested project can register themselves with the CIM Questionnaire.
             Project administrators are able to define a subset of the CIM metadata structure which they are interested in capturing in CIM Documents.
             Project members can than use the CIM Questionnaire Editing Forms to create those documents.
